# Sort-Intensity.X-ray-diffraction
Sort intensity values with relative 2θ degrees in CSV files obtained from X-ray diffraction data.
One of the most common problems in X-ray diffraction data is sorting the intensity values with relative 2θ degrees. This code sorts the intensity values with relative 2θ degrees by reading your CSV file and allows them to be saved in CSV files.
